## Running the program
In order to start the program, please run the html file in the browser. On each refresh, new, random data is generated.

## Specifications
The size of the canvas is set to be 450x450 pixels. This includes the grid itself which is 400x400 and 50 pixels buffer in which the labels are set. The range of randomly chosen values is from 0 to 100, from which then the x and y values are converted to match the pixel size of the canvas and the coordinate system.
The data values are also set bettween 0 and 100 and these are not later converted to match the canvas size.
